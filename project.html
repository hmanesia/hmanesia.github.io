    <h1>Energy Marketplace Projects & Gatby</h1>
    <p>
      This page collects some of my thinking around deregulated energy markets, customer choice, and how
      online marketplaces such as
      <a href="https://gatby.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gatby</a>
      can simplify the process of finding the right electricity plan.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Context: Why Electricity Plan Comparison Matters</h2>
      <p>
        In deregulated markets, customers aren’t locked into a single monopoly utility – they can choose
        from multiple retail electricity providers and plan structures. That flexibility is powerful, but
        it also introduces complexity: pricing can vary by term length, usage tier, time-of-use window,
        and whether the plan is fixed, variable, or indexed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many customers simply don’t have the time or appetite to read through every Electricity Facts
        Label (EFL). That’s where focused marketplaces come in: they aggregate options, standardize how
        plans are displayed, and reduce the friction of shopping for a better rate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Gatby as an Energy Marketplace</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://gatby.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gatby</a>
        is an online marketplace that helps customers compare retail electricity plans side by side.
        Instead of manually visiting multiple provider sites, a user can enter their service address
        once and see a curated list of options that match their location and utility.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a product and data perspective, this creates interesting challenges and opportunities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Normalizing plan data across providers, rate structures, and fees.</li>
        <li>Surfacing key information like contract length, rate type, TDU charges, and early termination fees.</li>
        <li>Helping customers understand trade-offs between short-term savings and long-term price stability.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="callout">
        For customers, the value is straightforward: marketplaces like
        <a href="https://gatby.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gatby</a>
        reduce decision fatigue and make it easier to avoid overpaying for electricity.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Example: Customer-Focused Plan Comparison</h2>
      <p>
        A simple but meaningful feature in an energy marketplace is the ability to filter and sort plans
        based on real-world goals: lowest estimated monthly bill, most stable fixed-rate option, or plans
        that include a higher share of renewable energy. Rather than forcing users to think in pure cents
        per kWh, the experience can be designed around practical questions like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“How much might I actually pay per month at my typical usage?”</li>
        <li>“What happens to my price if market rates spike?”</li>
        <li>“Which plans keep my bill the most predictable?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Platforms such as
        <a href="https://gatby.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gatby</a>
        are well-positioned to answer these questions by combining plan data,
        transmission and distribution charges, and usage assumptions into a clear, comparable view.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Ideas for Future Work</h2>
      <p>
        If I were extending an energy marketplace product, some areas I’d be interested in exploring include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Personalized plan recommendations based on a user’s risk tolerance and budget stability needs.</li>
        <li>Education flows that explain concepts like TDUs, time-of-use rates, and contract renewals.</li>
        <li>Survival analysis on customer tenure after enrolling through a marketplace, to better understand plan quality.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All of these ideas revolve around the same core principle: making complex electricity pricing
        structures more transparent and actionable for everyday customers, using platforms like
        <a href="https://gatby.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gatby</a>
        as the interface between retail providers and end users.
